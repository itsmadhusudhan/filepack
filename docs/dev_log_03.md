- Today I have added files group screen UI

- I made use of lazy grid and learnt more about it

- I have yet to add a proper color pallete so the colors are bit confusing

- To add groups I have used sealed classes as they are fixed number of items. Actually I had though
  of data class but went with sealed class instead

- I still need to figure out how to add the files count to each group card?
