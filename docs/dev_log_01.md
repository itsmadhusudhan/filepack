# 19 April 2023

I have just made an initial commit on my journey to build native android app with jetpack compose.

I'm building a file manager which is actually a clone of My files app on one plus phones.

I have experience with mobile development with react native and flutter.

I have also tried jetpack compose before to build a clock app.

This time I want to build complete app without dropping in the middle and learn things in depth.

I spent sometime in setting things up today. I just added a few dependencies and was able get the app to compile and run.

The actual work will be kicked off from tomorrow.
