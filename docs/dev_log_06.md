- I have used the directory walk api to fetch the files and show them but I need to refactor it and
  use a view model
  to query them in the beginning
- I had allow access to all the files permission in the system settings to access all the files.
- Need to setup an intent to open the settings and ask user to grant the permission
- There are still things which needs to be cleaned up but I'm still happy with the progress slowly
  figuring out things
